            <h4 class="card-text">Fall is finally here! Fall usually means cooler
              temperatures and changes of color in the leaves. Here are some
              safety tips for this upcoming Fall season!</h4>
            <ul class="card-text">
              <li><h4><span class="font-weight-bold">Be safe on Halloween.</span>
                Pedestrian and bicycle traffic significantly increases on and
                around Halloween. According to the National Safety Council,
                about 6,100 pedestrian deaths occurred in 2013. Their research
                also found that these deaths varied by age. Running into the
                road accounted for about 70 percent of pedestrian deaths or
                injuries for children ages 5-9 and about 47 percent for those
                ages 10-14. Adults should accompany young children while
                trick-or-treating. For older children going out alone, make sure
                an adult knows the route they’re going to take and give them a
                curfew. Trick-or-treaters should only approach familiar houses
                with the porch light on and should never, ever enter a
                stranger’s home.</h4></li>
              <li><h4><span class="font-weight-bold">Change smoke alarm batteries.</span>
                The batteries should be changed twice per year. Many people use
                Daylight Savings Time as an easy way to remember to change smoke
                alarm and carbon monoxide detector batteries.</h4></li>
              <li><h4><span class="font-weight-bold">Make sure your heater is working.</span>
                Before it gets too chilly, turn it on to test and make sure it
                sufficiently heats up your house. If it seems weak or isn’t
                working at all, call a professional. You don’t want to get stuck
                in a bind when the weather hits freezing temperatures.</h4></li>
              <li><h4><span class="font-weight-bold">Be careful with space heaters.</span>
                They may be small, but they pack a powerful punch, able to heat
                one area or room on their own. Make sure there is plenty of
                space around the heater so it can vent and you don’t want it to
                accidentally set something close to it on fire. Don’t leave a
                space heater unattended.</h4></li>
              <li><h4><span class="font-weight-bold">Watch for poor weather conditions while driving.</span>
                Rain, snow, fog, ice, and wet leaves are only a few dangers you
                may encounter on the road over the next few months. Roads can
                become slippery and visibility decreases in poor conditions,
                making pedestrians, bicycles, animals, and road signs hard to
                see.</h4></li>
